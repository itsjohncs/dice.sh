# dice.sh

A simple online console-like dice roller that will eventually be available at [https://dice.sh](https://dice.sh).

## Planned feature set

* Networked rooms so you can share rolls.
* A CLI you can pull off of `npm`.
* Ability to `ssh dice.sh` and get the CLI interface.
* Ability to `telnet dice.sh` and get the CLI interface.

## Why this is getting made

The short story: because `dice.sh` is too good of a domain name to not build this onto.

The longer story: when looking at dice-related domains for an unrelated project, [domaintyper](https://domaintyper.com) told me `dice.sh` was available for purchase. After building a quick prototype I found out that it actually was not, so I launched the prototype to [diceroller.sh](https://diceroller.sh) and moved on. A couple days later I started wondering _why_ Domain Typer was confused and looked into the `whois` entries for `dice.sh` and found out that it was expiring. A couple weeks of daily querying later and I owned `dice.sh` and the project was back on!
